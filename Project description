In March 2017, two colleagues of mine and I decided to deepen some aspects of
the Experiment in Physics II course we attended at University until June 2017. So,
we bought an old analogic oscilloscope (Telequipment D54), we borrowed some
passive electronic components from the University lab and we repeated some of the
lab experiences we previously had done at University. Those experiences consisted
of studying the frequency response of basic circuits such as low-pass, high-pass
and band-pass filters.
Needing a voltage signal generator, we benefitted from an open source project by
Oleh C. on www.github.com (Simple Sine Wave Generator), which consisted of a
simple sound generator program implemented in C++, using the JUCE library.
Then, this sound signal generator was used as a voltage signal generator thanks to
a dismantled audio jack onto which two thin electric cables were soldered. Once
plugged into the computer, with the above-mentioned C++ program, the jack
allowed for the transmission of a sinusoidal voltage signal to the input of our
circuits. The result was a basic function generator which could only work in the
audio band. Despite this restriction, we managed to replicate many of the lab
experiences, practicing with the oscilloscope, and familiarizing with fitting in ROOT.
